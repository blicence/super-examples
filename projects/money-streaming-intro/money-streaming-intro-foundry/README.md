# Welcome to the Money Router

### A basic example to get you started with the Superfluid Constant Flow Agreement

This example has a Youtube walkthrough to go along with it! You can watch it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mwbYQ429IU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mwbYQ429IU). Note that this tutorial only walks through the contract, not the Foundry test suite or package setup.

If you'd like to see a breakdown of the test file for this example, you can find a Youtube tutorial on this here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_PGd8CPdfg&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_PGd8CPdfg&t=1s).
